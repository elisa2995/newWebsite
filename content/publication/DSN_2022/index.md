abstract: An ongoing battle has been running for more than a decade between e-commerce websites owners and web scrapers. Whenever one party finds a new technique to prevail, the other one comes up with a solution to defeat it. Based on our industrial experience, we know this problem is far from being solved. New solutions are needed to address automated threats. In this work, we will describe the actors taking part in the battle, the weapons at their disposal, and their allies on either side. We will present a real-world setup to explain how e-commerce websites operators try to defend themselves and the open problems they seek solutions for.
