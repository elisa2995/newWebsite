abstract: 'Residential IP Proxies (RESIPs) enable proxying requests through large networks of residential devices used concurrently by genuine users. These proxies are attractive to malicious actors because of their advantages in automated campaigns, including access to reputable residential IPs and integrated services like automated CAPTCHA solving. In this talk, we will showcase various types of attacks that exploit these proxies and introduce new methods to detect and prevent their activity on the server side. We will present successful results from applying these techniques in both semi-controlled and real-world environments. Additionally, we will offer new insights into the inner working and modus operandi of RESIPs, derived from our data collections.'
